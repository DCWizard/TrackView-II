A Simple Video Player 

Based on TrackView org which is based on WFPlayer

Special thanks to https://github.com/zhw2590582/WFPlayer for the Very nice design

This version is superior

It has a Spectrum analyser

It let your hear sample of sound as you move the cursor like in Premiere Pro.
Every editor I tried don't have that feature;

N.B. Apparently, I have to give you the technology. No one else has come with such an easy feature. 
Yeah, I'm talking to you WonderShare for example. I've been asking you for that feature for more than 10 years.

To see, to use... ect.

Just open the TrackView II.html in your browser.

You don't even need a web server.

N.b.; You'll have the enhanced version on a server though.
